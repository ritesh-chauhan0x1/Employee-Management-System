## Dependency Management and node_modules

This project uses `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to manage all dependencies for both backend and frontend. The `node_modules` folder is automatically generated by running `npm install` and should **not** be committed to version control.

- All required packages are listed in `package.json`.
- To install all dependencies, simply run `npm install` in the relevant directory (`backend` or `frontend`).
- The `node_modules` folder can be thousands of files and is not included in this repository.
- If you ever need to regenerate `node_modules`, delete the folder and run `npm install` again.

**Never commit `node_modules` to your repository.**

For a full list of dependencies, see the `package.json` files in each project folder.
 

# Employee Management System (MEAN Stack)

## Overview
A full-stack, production-ready CRUD application where users can add, update, view, and delete employee records using Angular (frontend), Express/Node.js (backend), and MongoDB (database).

## Features
- JWT authentication (login/register/logout)
- Role-based access (Admin, HR, Employee)
- Secure password storage (bcrypt)
- Employee CRUD (add, view, update, soft delete)
- Search, sort, pagination, and advanced filters (role, status, salary range)
- Material UI, responsive design, theme toggle (light/dark)
- Dashboard with charts (employee stats, salary distribution)
- File upload for profile pictures
- Export employee list (CSV/Excel/PDF)
- Notification system (toasts)
- Route guards for protected pages
- Centralized error handling, logging, and input validation
- Audit fields (createdBy, updatedBy)
- API and E2E tests (Jest, Cypress)
- Docker & docker-compose for full stack
- CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions)

## Backend Setup
1. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	cd backend
	npm install
	```
2. Set up MongoDB and update `.env` (see `.env.example`).
3. Seed sample data (admin user, employees):
	```sh
	npm run seed
	```
4. Start backend server:
	```sh
	npm run dev
	# or
	npm start
	```
	The backend runs on http://localhost:4000
5. Run API tests:
	```sh
	npm test
	```

## Frontend Setup
1. Install Angular CLI if not installed:
	```sh
	npm install -g @angular/cli
	```
2. Create Angular app (if not already):
	```sh
	cd frontend
	ng new . --routing --style=scss
	```
3. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	npm install
	ng add @angular/material
	npm install @angular/forms @angular/router @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations chart.js ng2-charts
	```
4. Add proxy config `proxy.conf.json`:
	```json
	{
	  "/api": {
		 "target": "http://localhost:4000",
		 "secure": false
	  }
	}
	```
5. Update `angular.json` to use the proxy config for serve.
6. Start Angular app:
	```sh
	ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
	```
	The frontend runs on http://localhost:4200

## Usage
1. Start MongoDB (locally or with Docker)
2. Start backend and frontend as above
3. Register/login as admin, HR, or employee
4. Manage employees, view dashboard, use all features

## Example Admin Credentials (after seeding)
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123

## Docker
To run the full stack with Docker:
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

## Contributing & Quality
- Lint: `npm run lint` (frontend/backend)
- Format: `npm run format`
- Test: `npm test` (backend), `ng test` (frontend)
